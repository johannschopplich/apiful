# Adapters

Adapters are used to handle requests and responses to and from the API. You can choose from the following pre-built adapters:

- [`ofetch`](/adapters/ofetch)
- [`apiRouteBuilder`](/adapters/route-builder)
- [`OpenAPI`](/adapters/openapi)

Alternatively, you can create your own custom adapter to meet your specific requirements.
