# Adapters

Adapters are used to handle requests and responses to and from the API. You can choose from the following pre-built adapters:

- [ofetch](/adapters/ofetch)
- [OpenAPI](/adapters/openapi)
- [Route Builder](/adapters/route-builder)

Alternatively, you can create your own custom adapter to meet your specific requirements.
