# Built-in Extensions

All extensions included in APIful by default provide a call signature that allows you to make API requests. You can add multiple extensions to a client by chaining the `with` method.

Depending on your use case and personal preference, you can choose from the following pre-built extensions:

- [ofetch](/extensions/ofetch)
- [OpenAPI](/extensions/openapi)
- [API Router](/extensions/api-router)
